Raycaster
=========

Primitive 3D Raycasting graphics engine written by Josh Rees-Jones.

This primitive raycaster uses the concept of raycasting to create a 3D perspective on a 2D map. This project is very buggy, but it was the result of learning graphics in a week and learning and implemented raycasting in 3 days.



Controls
--------

Move with WASD. Sometimes, left and right arrow keys crash the game. Press escape or close the window to exit.



Which files are which?
----------------------

- `Raycaster.py` is the final product
- `raycaster_v{version}.py` files are non-final versions
- `memorypuzzle.py` and `puzzle.py` are testing grounds for graphics
- `RayForge.py` is someone else's raycaster - I used it as somewhat of a reference when I got stuck.
- `bebas-neue/` is a directory that stores the font used in `memorypuzzle.py` and `puzzle.py`
