From NAND to Tetris
===================

[From NAND to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) is a course in low-level computer architecture written by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. I took this class at [NCSSM](http://ncssm.edu) under Dr. John Morrison. The goal of the class is to build a virtual computer starting with NAND gates, hence "From NAND to Tetris". We didn't quite make it that far, but we did get to graphics. This repository is the result of that class.
