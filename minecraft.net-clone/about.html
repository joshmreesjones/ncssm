			<h1>Inspiration</h1>
			<p>
				This site was made as a fanpage for AP Computer Science A (I).
				The site's layout is based on Mojang's official Minecraft website.

			<h1>About Minecraft</h1>
			<p>
				Minecraft was started by Markus "Notch" Persson as a small indie game
				title. Minecraft's popularity grew and attracted major attention from game
				awards, magazines, websites, etc. However, most of Minecraft's publicity
				comes from word of mouth. Mojang has never publicly advertised Minecraft and
				yet over 8,000,000 players have bought the game. Mojang plans on developing
				Minecraft until interest lowers and then releasing it as open-source, but
				it doesn't look like that will happen any time soon. Mojang regularly
				sells over 10,000 copies of the game every day.

			<h1>The site</h1>
			<p>
				This website has a total of 410 lines of code (including HTML and CSS). It
				is XHTML 1.0 Transitional validated.
